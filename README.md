# Music Genre Project with Python 
*  This section is a Python project introduing a basic command coding for a music genre model
*  In this project, we gave a detailed analysis to music genre where basic music features are displayed in the music dataframe. 
*  The purpose of our study is to provide an insight on how music genre influences people's life 
*  However, the result for this music genre isn't unique and not as accuracy as we expected, which we will have a further study.
*  In other words, we will have further analysis to issues that we found from the project by next section
